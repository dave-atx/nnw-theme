# NetNewsWire theme format

Read this when changing theme structure, metadata, scripts, or resources.

The one root-level `<Name>.nnwtheme` directory is the release bundle. It contains
exactly `Info.plist`, `template.html`, `stylesheet.css`, and optional license or notice
files. NetNewsWire does not serve arbitrary bundle-local assets: do not add fonts,
images, media, or references to them. Small demonstrated assets may use data URLs.

`Info.plist` requires non-empty `ThemeIdentifier`, `Name`, `CreatorHomePage`, and
`CreatorName`, plus an integer `Version`. `Name` and the bundle stem match exactly,
including spaces and capitalization. `CreatorHomePage` is an absolute HTTP(S) URL.
The identifier and bundle name stay stable after the first release.

NetNewsWire performs two single-pass substitutions. First, article values replace
macros in `template.html`; then that body and combined core/theme CSS enter a platform
page skeleton. Unknown macros remain literal, and substituted values are not scanned
again. Common template macros are visible in the starter markup and synthetic
fixtures.

Article text scales through a different mechanism on each platform, and a theme must
honor both. On macOS the app substitutes `text_size_class` in `template.html` with one
of `smallText`, `mediumText`, `largeText`, `xLargeText`, or `xxLargeText`, and the
theme's CSS supplies the sizes; an unset preference means `largeText`, not `mediumText`.
On iOS and iPadOS the app leaves `text_size_class` unsubstituted and replaces the
`font-size` macro in the stylesheet with the reader's Dynamic Type body size instead.
NetNewsWire emits the capital-L `xLargeText` and `xxLargeText` while its bundled themes
select the lowercase spellings, so define both.

Neither rule needs a platform query. A macOS render leaves the `font-size` macro
literal, exactly as the app does, so that declaration is invalid there and is dropped;
the size classes are inert on iOS, where the app never sets one. Do not reach for
`@supports (-webkit-touch-callout: none)` even though NetNewsWire's own stylesheet
uses it: no desktop WebKit implements that property, so every preview resolves the iOS
branch as false and platform-conditional CSS is checked the wrong way round. Do not
write macro names in double brackets inside comments either, because substitution
rewrites those too: a body containing `-->`, as every Reddit post does, closes the
comment early and shows the rest of it as text. `check` fails on them. NetNewsWire's stylesheet also sets `font: -apple-system-body` at
`:root`; a theme with its own typography should not, because that shorthand resets
`font-family` and `line-height`.

The renderer pins NetNewsWire `mac-7.1.3` commit
`f2daca0f24f29c08d9cb16e1bdc56293fd6fe286`. It uses upstream `core.css`, macOS and
iOS page skeletons, and `main.js`, `main_mac.js`, `main_ios.js`, and `newsfoot.js`.
These files ship inside the `nnw-theme` package, verified by SHA-256, so previews work
offline. iPhone and iPad share the iOS skeleton. WebKit native
color-scheme emulation controls light/dark captures; CSS is not rewritten.

Inline scripts in `template.html` are supported. External scripts and stylesheets are
rejected. Remote theme-owned fonts, images, audio, or video require an explicit local
warning override and are still blocked during checks. The article must remain useful
when Article JavaScript is off; those smoke renders remove theme inline scripts while
retaining NetNewsWire’s injected scripts.
